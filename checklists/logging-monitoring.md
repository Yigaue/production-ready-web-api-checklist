# Logging & Monitoring Checklist

- Log errors with context — improves debugging.
- Use request or correlation IDs — enables tracing.
- Separate error and access logs — improves clarity.
- Monitor error rates and latency — detects regressions.
- Alert on critical failures — enables fast response.
- Avoid logging secrets — prevents exposure.
